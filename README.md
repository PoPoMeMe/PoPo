<summary><strong>1. What this folder is</strong> — what the judge pack contains and the repo layout</summary>

A **judge-facing excerpt pack**: it explains the architecture and shows the
hard/interesting parts of the code as curated snippets. It is **not** the full
repository and deliberately omits:

- complete contract / application source trees,
- deployment scripts, deployed addresses, private keys and `.env` files,
- internal admin tooling and operational runbooks.

Each snippet is a short, self-contained excerpt of production code (comments
kept, surrounding boilerplate removed) plus a "why it matters" note.

<summary><strong>2. The product in 30 seconds</strong> — problem / solution / audience / moat + creator-economy flywheel</summary>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | Creators have no way to launch a tradeable IP coin and earn *ongoing* value from it; launchpads dump liquidity into dead AMMs and give creators nothing after launch. |
| **Solution** | One contract system covers the full lifecycle: **bonding-curve launch → graduation → concentrated-liquidity market**, with creator fees, token-gated video episodes, daily algorithmic buyback-and-burn, and two-level referrals — all settled in one gas-efficient multi-token vault. |
| **Audience** | Meme/IP creators and their communities; prediction-market users. |
| **Moat** | Deep on-chain integration (v4-style custom PoolManager + hooks, not a fork wrapper), an off-chain content/social layer secured by EIP-712 signatures, and a creator-economy flywheel (episode revenue → buyback → burn → holders). |

### The creator-economy flywheel

<summary><strong>3. Tech stack</strong> — Solidity/Diamond · React 19/viem/Privy · Supabase · multi-chain (incl. Monad testnet)</summary>

**Smart contracts** — Solidity `0.8.20`, Hardhat, EIP-2535 Diamond pattern.

**Frontend** — React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, viem 2,
Privy embedded wallets, Three.js / Framer Motion.

**Off-chain** — Supabase Postgres + Deno Edge Functions; all user writes are
authorized by an EIP-712 signature the function verifies with `ecrecover`
(Supabase Auth disabled, service-role writes only).

**Media** — Supabase Storage + Service-Worker/WebRTC P2P CDN offload.

**Networks** — Multi-chain by design (URL-routed): the same unforked codebase is
deployed across X Layer mainnet, Sei mainnet/testnet, Mantle Sepolia,
Robinhood Chain testnet, Arc testnet and **Monad Testnet (chainId 10143)**, plus a
local Hardhat node. The read path and write path are explicitly de-synchronized to
survive wallet chain-switch lag.

<summary><strong>5. Technical highlights (judges: start here) ⭐</strong> — the 7 hardest engineering problems, solved</summary>

1. **Bonding-curve → CLM migration in one contract.** After the curve
   completes, the same Diamond initializes a v4-style pool, derives the starting
   sqrt-price from the curve reserves with 512-bit math, computes the maximal
   full-range liquidity, and locks it in a Diamond-owned position — no LP
   tokens, no external router. → `snippets/contracts/02-graduation-migration.md`

2. **Custom Uniswap-v4-style PoolManager + Hooks, from scratch.** Ticks,
   tick-bitmap, `SwapMath`, flash-accounting `unlock`/`settle`/`take`, and an
   address-flag-gated hook dispatcher — written against our ERC-6909 multi-token
   ledger, not forked. → `snippets/contracts/03-poolmanager-hooks.md`

3. **Creator fee hook with market-cap-tiered pricing.** A CREATE2-mined hook
   address (`0x44` permission bits) charges fees in the afterSwap delta; the fee
   tier is evaluated at the *pre-trade* price so a trade can't manipulate its
   own fee class. → `snippets/contracts/03-poolmanager-hooks.md`

4. **ERC-6909 single-vault settlement.** Every asset — $P quote, all launched
   coins — is an internal id on one ledger with strict 1:1 ERC20 backing,
   eliminating hop-by-hop token transfers across curve, pool, referrals and
   buybacks. → `snippets/contracts/04-vault-erc6909.md`

5. **Permissionless daily buyback-and-burn.** Episode revenue funds a per-coin
   treasury; anyone can trigger one swap per UTC day through a stateless router,
   with a sqrt-price-limit slippage guard; bought coins are burned on the spot.
   → `snippets/contracts/06-episodes-buyback.md`

6. **Passwordless authz for off-chain writes.** Supabase Auth is off: every
   write Edge Function reconstructs an EIP-712 digest and runs `ecrecover`,
   with a 10-min freshness window, canonical-JSON payloads and realm separation.
   → `snippets/app/01-eip712-wallet-auth.md`

7. **Trustless client in a multi-chain world.** On-chain `canCall(address,
   selector)` is the only admin source of truth (no client allowlist); a
   getLogs-based fallback indexer reconstructs trades/holders when the server
   can't reach the user's RPC (e.g. localhost). → `snippets/app/04-onchain-indexer.md`

<summary><strong>6. Feature checklist</strong> — launch/trading · AMM · creator economy · growth · prediction · infra</summary>

**Launch & trade (PPHatchSwap)**
- [x] Permissionless coin creation with on-chain creation fee, metadata, 18-decimals
- [x] xy=k virtual-reserve bonding curve, platform + creator fees on buy/sell
- [x] Slippage protection (`minTokensOut` / `minQuoteOut`)

- [x] Hook flags via low address bits (`beforeSwap` / `afterSwap` + delta-return)
- [x] Market-cap-tiered creator fees post-graduation

**Content & creator economy**
- [x] Token-gated / paid video episodes per coin (on-chain access mapping)

<summary><strong>7. Monad Metropolis bounty artifacts</strong> — Envio indexer · MetaMask Agent plugin · bounty writeups · live on-chain market</summary>

Built specifically for the Monad hackathon (execution status:
[`bounty-submissions/README.md`](./bounty-submissions/README.md), full plan:
[`docs/2026-10-11-monad-metropolis-bounty-plan.md`](./docs/2026-10-11-monad-metropolis-bounty-plan.md)):

| Artifact | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`envio-indexer/`](./envio-indexer/) | **Envio HyperIndex v2** real-time indexer for PoPo.meme on Monad testnet: 8 events (Hatch `TokenCreated`/`Buy`/`Sell`/`BondingCurveComplete` + prediction `Buy`/`Sell`/`BuyBatch`/`SellBatch`) → 7 typed entities, GraphQL/REST API. Both facets share one Diamond address. Runnable (`npm i && envio dev`). |
| [`metamask-agent-plugin/`](./metamask-agent-plugin/) | **MetaMask Agent Wallet** plugin `mm-plugin-popo` with 8 `mm popo …` commands — quote/trade/markets/market/position/predict/vault/deposit — wired to the Monad Diamond with real bonding-curve math and typed contract calls. |
| [`bounty-submissions/`](./bounty-submissions/) | Submission writeups: Privy (P0, embedded-wallet-only signing), Envio, Alchemy Supernode/Enhanced APIs, MetaMask Agent Wallet. |

A live prediction market was also opened and smoke-tested on-chain during the
event (market digest `0x7fd5…3e52`, YES/NO 52/53).

<summary><strong>8. 5-minute demo</strong> — login → create coin → trade → graduate → paid episode/buyback → prediction market</summary>

See [`DEMO-SCRIPT.md`](./DEMO-SCRIPT.md). Short path:

1. **0:30** — Email login → Privy creates an embedded wallet; fund it.
2. **1:00** — Create a coin (name, art, reserve %) → instant bonding-curve market.
3. **2:00** — Buy/sell live; show price curve, fees accruing to creator, referral link.
4. **3:00** — Graduate → pool auto-seeded in the v4-style AMM; hook fee keeps paying creator.
5. **4:00** — Upload a paid episode → buy access as a fan → trigger daily buyback-and-burn.
6. **4:45** — Open the prediction market and show YES/NO share purchase & settlement.

<summary><strong>9. Security considerations</strong> — on-chain role gating · EIP-712 verification · callback auth · slippage · fund integrity · vesting</summary>

- **Diamond + per-selector roles**: privileged functions are gated on chain via
  `AccessControl.canCall(account, selector)`; the client never decides.
- **Signature layer**: EIP-712 with timestamp freshness (replay protection),
  canonical JSON, domain (realm) separation; service-role key never leaves the
  Edge Function.
- **Migration callback auth**: `unlockCallback` accepts only self-Diamond calls
  inside an open unlock session, preventing hook/external replay of seeded
  positions.
- **Slippage**: curve trades take explicit minima; buyback enforces a sqrt-price
  limit; hook fees are int128-clamped.
- **Fund integrity**: referral carve-outs and pending totals are deducted from
  admin-withdrawable platform fees, so fee money can never be double-spent.
- **Vesting**: creator reserve tokens are non-transferable through the curve
  until cliff/vest conditions after graduation.
